# Simple Todo App

This is a todo app, that needed refactoring to organize the code properly to edit in a clean structured manner.

You can add a new task with the name, date and time. You can also delete the task and checkmark it off your list as you please.

## Technology

We used basic JavaScript, html and CSS.
